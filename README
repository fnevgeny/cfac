FAC is a software package for the calculation of various atomic processes,
written by Ming Feng Gu at the Space Science Laboratory of Berkeley.

cFAC was started around 2010 (based on FAC-1.1.1, released in 2006) as a
maintenance project due to a lack of interest from the original author in the
last years. The main focus is on providing large volumes of data as required,
e.g., for collisional-radiative plasma modeling.  See ChangeLog for details. The
original file, documenting development up to the version 1.1.1, is kept as
doc/ChangeLog.MFG.

Recently, Ming Feng Gu kindly agreed to release the FAC sources under the GPL
(version 3 or higher) license, and the repository is currently made public on
GitHub, <https://github.com/fnevgeny/fac/>.

Some bits of the FAC sources, which are still used in cFAC, were published in
the Computer Physics Communications journal, and as such, are explcitly licensed
for non-profit or academic use only, see
<http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html>. As a result, the combined
software is not redistributable. This issue may be fixed in a future release.


Prerequisites:
1) The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>,
   version 1.15 or above (earlier versions will NOT work).
2) The SQLite software library <http://www.sqlite.org/>.

Note: If you install the above software using a package manager of your OS, make
      sure you select the development packages (*-dev*).

Installation:
1) ./configure
Note 1: Specify --prefix=my/dir, if the default /usr/local is not what you 
        want. This directory only affects the installation of the sfac
        executable.
Note 2: Use the "--with-extrainc" and "--with-extralib" options if the
        third-party libraries are not installed in the default system place.
Note 3: Run ./configure --help for more options.

2) make

3) make check
This will run a test suite of demo scripts. Any error should be reported!

4) make install
This installs the "sfac" binary.

Usage:
The "sfac" executable accepts an input file as its only argument. See the demo
directory for examples. For more details, please read the manual, and be sure to
read the FAQ section of it.

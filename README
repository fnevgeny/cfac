FAC and cFAC:

FAC is a software package for the calculation of various atomic processes,
written by Ming Feng Gu at the Space Science Laboratory of Berkeley.

cFAC was started around 2010 (based on FAC-1.1.1, released in 2006), initially
focusing on providing large volumes of data as required, e.g., for
collisional-radiative plasma modeling, and eliminating reliance upon third-party
Fortran numerical libraries with their C equivalents (hence the change in the
package name). See ChangeLog for details. The original file, documenting
development up to version 1.1.1, is kept as doc/ChangeLog.MFG.

Recently, Ming Feng Gu kindly agreed to release the FAC sources under the GPL
(version 3 or higher) license, and the repository is currently made public on
GitHub, <https://github.com/fnevgeny/fac/>.

Some bits of the FAC sources, which are still used in cFAC, were published in
the Computer Physics Communications journal, and as such, are licensed for
non-profit or academic use only, please see
<http://cpc.cs.qub.ac.uk/licence/licence.html>.

In order to compile in these CPC-licensed modules, you need to pass the
"--with-cpc-modules" configure flag and explicitly agree to the CPC licensing
terms. Please note that as a result, the "sfac" executable will not be
redistributable!


Prerequisites:

1) c and fortran compiler (such as gcc and gfortran).

2) The GNU Scientific Library (GSL) <http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>,
   version 1.15 or above (earlier versions will NOT work).

3) The SQLite software library <http://www.sqlite.org/>.

4) Document building tools, help2man, pdflatex.

Note: If you install the above software using a package manager of your OS, make
      sure you select the development packages (*-dev*).

In Ubuntu distribution,
```
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev -y
- sudo apt-get install sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev -y
- sudo apt-get install gfortran -y
- sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
- sudo apt-get install help2man -y
- sudo apt-get install texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-extra -y
```
Does install everything required.


Installation:

1) `autoconf -o configure ac-tools/configure.ac`

Generate `configure file`.

2) `./configure`
Note 1: Specify --prefix=my/dir, if the default /usr/local is not what you
        want.
Note 2: Use the "--with-extrainc" and "--with-extralib" options if the
        third-party libraries are not installed in the default system place.
Note 3: Run ./configure --help for more options.

3) `make`

4) `make check`
This will run a test suite of demo scripts. Any error should be reported!

5) `make install`
This installs the "sfac" binary, as well as the CFACDB library, C header file,
and utility.

# Usage:
The "sfac" executable accepts an input file as its only argument. See the "demo"
directory for examples. For more details, please read the manual, and be sure to
read the FAQ section of it.

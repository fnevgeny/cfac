\chapter{Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)}
\section{General}
\faq{What are the differences between \cFAC and FAC}{
In \cFAC, only the SFAC interface is retained (the Python PFAC binding is no
longer there). Also removed were the simple collisional-radiative-model
(crm) and line-polarization (pol) executables. The SFAC interface
(as provided by sfac) is mostly backward compatible, meaning that scripts
that worked with FAC will likely continue to with \cFAC unmodifed.

\cFAC adds possibility to store the calculated results in an SQLite-based
format, allowing for selecting subsets of data for various uses based on the
powerful SQL query language. The cFACdb library, which is part of the \cFAC
distribution, is provided to facilitate access to the SQLite \cFAC databases
from third-party C and Fortran codes.}

\faq{What operating systems does \cFAC run on}{
\cFAC is written in a mixture of ANSI C and Fortran 77, all of them are in
principle platform independent. However, the mixed language programming makes it
more easily installed in modern UNIX-like systems than others. So far, it has
been tested to work under Solaris, Linux, Mac OS X, and MS Windows with the UNIX
API emulation provided by Cygwin.}
  
\faq{How does \cFAC differ from other atomic codes}{
The theoretical methods used in \cFAC are similar to some other distorted-wave
atomic codes, such as HULLAC and differ from more elaborate programs based on
close-coupling approximations, such as the Belfast R-Matrix code. The biggest
advantage of \cFAC is its ease of use and its scriptability.}

\faq{Which atomic processes can or cannot be calculated with \cFAC}{
\cFAC can calculate energy levels, radiative transition rates of arbitrary
multipole type, collisional excitation and ionization cross sections by
electron impact, photoionization and radiative recombination cross sections and
autoionization rates. In the current form, \cFAC does not treat two-photon
decays.}

\faq{What is a typical accuracy of the atomic parameters calculated with
\cFAC}{
The ions other than H-like, the accuracy of energy levels are usually a few
eV, which translates to 10--30 m{\AA} for the wavelength at $\sim$10{\AA}. For
radiative transition rates and cross sections, the accuracy is
$\sim$10--20\%. Data for near-neutral ions or atoms may have even larger
errors.}

\faq{Can \cFAC be used to calculate atomic parameters for non-X-ray (UV,
optical, etc.) lines}{
For multiply-charged ions, non-X-ray lines usually result from the transitions
within the same complex, which usually have large relative uncertainties in
the calculated wavelengths and transition rates. The accuracy for UV and
optical lines from near-neutral ions is also very limited.}

\faq{Are there standard references to FAC}{
The first paper that used results of FAC is \cite{gu:2003a}. The code itself was
described later \cite{gu:2008a}, which can be used as the reference.}

\faq{Are there standard references to \cFAC}{
There are none yet.}

\faq{How do I report bugs or make suggestions}{
Please use the ``Issues'' tool of the \cFAC

\section{Atomic Structure}
\faq{How do I specify a bare ion}{
The bare ion is indicated by a call to \funcref['', group='b']{Config}, i.e.,
the first argument of \funcref{Config} is an empty string.}

\faq{Which configurations should be used as basis for the mean configuration
which optimizes the radial potential}{
The function \funcref{OptimizeRadial} accepts a list of configurations, which form
the basis for the construction of the mean configuration. Usually, only the
lowest lying configurations should be used in \funcref{OptimizeRadial} for the
construction of mean configuration. It has been found that using configurations
corresponding to the ground complex is almost always a good idea. Sometimes, it
maybe worthwhile to include the first excited configurations. However, it is
always a bad practice to include very highly excited configurations, especially
those inner shell excited ones.}

\faq{Can I use a specific mean configuration to be used in potential
optimization}{
The function \funcref{AvgConfig} may be used to set the mean configuration for
the potential optimization. In this case, the function
\funcref{OptimizeRadial} must be called with no arguments.}

\faq{How do I know what mean configuration is used in the potential
optimization, if one is not given specifically by \funcref{AvgConfig}}{
The function \funcref{GetPotential} may be called after \funcref{OptimizeRadial}
to obtain the mean configuration used, and the resulting radial potential.}

\faq{When calculating ionization or recombination processes, should I use the
mean configuration for recombined (ionizing) or recombining (ionized) ion}{
Usually, it does not matter for highly charged ions. However, for low-$Z$
elements the difference of one more or one less electron, screening the nuclear
charge, may be substantial. In this case, one may have to make a decision by
comparing the results to experimental values or other theoretical works.}

\faq{How do I determine which configurations should be interacting}{
This depends on the computer resource available and the desired accuracy. The
dimension of the Hamiltonian matrix increases very rapidly as the number of
interacting configurations grows. The convergence with respect to the
configuration interaction is usually slow. For applications which \cFAC is
primarily designed for, one typically includes only configurations within the
same complex, except for some low-lying configurations.}

\faq{What relativistic effects are included}{
The standard Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonian is used in \cFAC, which means that the
spin--orbit interaction, mass-effect and other leading relativistic effects are
fully treated. However, higher-order QED effects, such as retardation and
recoil are only included in the Breit interaction with zero energy limit for
the exchanged photon. Vacuum polarization and self-energy corrections are
treated in the screened hydrogenic approximation.}

\section{Collisional Excitation}
\faq{Why are there multiple data blocks in the output corresponding to a single
call of \funcref{CETable} sometimes}{
Sometimes, the transition array corresponding to a given call to \funcref{CETable}
include transitions with a wide range of excitation energies. This typically
happens for transitions within a single complex or transitions between more
than 2 complexes are mixed together in one call of \funcref{CETable} (which should
generally be avoided). Since the excitation radial integrals are only
calculated on a few-point transition energy grid, it is undesirable to have a
very wide range in the actual transition energies. \funcref{CETable} avoid this by
subdivide the transitions in groups. Within each group, the transition
energies does not vary by more than a factor of 5. A different transition
energy grid and collision energy grid are used for different groups, and
therefore, corresponding to different data blocks in the output.}

\faq{Can I use a different collision energy grid}{
A collision energy grid in terms of the energy of the scattered electron is
automatically constructed if one is not specified prior to calling
\funcref{CETable}. One may use the function \funcref{SetCEGrid} to specify a
different grid. Or one may use \funcref{SetUsrCEGrid} to have a user grid
different from the grid on which the collision strengths are calculated.}

\faq{Why are collision strengths at very high energies incorrect}{
Due to a limited radial grid size, the collision strengths at energies much
higher than the excitation energy (more than a few hundred times higher) are
unlikely to be reliable. However, the high energy collision strengths should not
be calculated directly. Instead, the Bethe and Born limit parameters in the
output should be used to obtain them.}

\section{Photoionization and Radiative Recombination}
\faq{When can I use the function \funcref{RecStates} to construct the
recombined states instead of specifying their configurations by \funcref{Config}}{
The function \funcref{RecStates} can only be used if the free electron is captured
to an empty orbital.}

\faq{Why do the bound--free oscillator strengths differ from some other
theoretical calculation by a constant factor}{
The bound--free differential oscillator strengths calculated by \cFAC have units
of hartree$^{-1}$. Also the values depend on the normalization of continuum
orbitals. It is therefore possible that they differ from other theoretical
calculations by a constant factor. One should always use the formula in this
manual to convert them to photoionization or
radiative recombination cross sections.}

\faq{Can I use only the fitting formula and ignore the tabulated $gf$
values}{
The fitting formula and the parameters given for the bound--free oscillator
strengths are only valid at high energies (beyond the largest energy of the
photo-electron energy grid). This means that the $gf$ values at energies
within the photo-electron energy grid should be calculated by interpolation
instead of the fitting formula. Often, however, this is only necessary for the
ionization of valence shells of near neutral ions and atoms, since only in
these cases, the near threshold behavior of the $gf$ values differ from the
fitting formula significantly.}

\section{Autoionization and Dielectronic Recombination}{
\faq{How do I improve the energies of low-lying $\Delta n = 0$ resonances}{
The energies of low-lying $\Delta n = 0$ resonances can not be calculated
accurately. This greatly reduces the reliability of the resulting dielectronic
recombination rates. In \cFAC, there is a method to improve the accuracy of
these energies by adjusting the core transition energies according to the
experimental values. The function \funcref{CorrectEnergy} is used to modify the
calculated energy levels by specified amount.}

\faq{Why is it advised to make separate calls to \funcref{AITable} for different
bound or free state complexes}{
The autoionization radial integrals are only calculated for a few free
electron energies. The actual values are interpolated from them. This only
works well if the free electron energy after autoionization does not vary
widely. Therefore, one should avoid calling \funcref{AITable} with bound or free
states in different complexes. e.g., KLL and KLM resonances should be
calculated with two separate calls to \funcref{AITable}.}

\section{Collisional Ionization}
\faq{Why is the \key{DW} mode so slow compared to the \key{BED} and \key{CB}
modes}{
In the \key{DW} mode, the ionization radial integrals are calculated by
summing up partial wave contributions. This is a time consuming process as
now there are two continuum electrons involved. The \key{CB} mode, in which the
radial integrals are simply looked up in a table, is therefore the fastest
method. In the \key{BED} mode, the radial integrals are calculated using the
bound--free differential oscillator strengths, which can be computed much
faster than the \key{DW} ionization radial integrals.}
